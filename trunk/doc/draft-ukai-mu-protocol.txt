1.   Abstract

This draft serve as a formal definition of the Mu Protocol.
The Mu Protocol has been used as a method for notifying 
URL to other members in some IRC channel, where "fumi-kun"
is listening.

2. Conventions used in this document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3. Protocol Overview

For a long time, we have used some convention to notify some
interesting URL on IRC channel.  We called it as "mu" protocol,
because we usually say "む URL" or "む URL <comment for this URL>"
in such case.  It's very easy way and this information is very 
useful for us, and we hope for everyone.  Therefore, we use it
to collect useful URL informaton on IRC channel. 

4. Formal Syntax

The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
Form (BNF) as described in [ABNF]

Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
sensitive. 


   CR = %x0D	;; ASCII CR, carriage return

   CRLF = CR LF

   LF = %x0A    ;; ASCII LF, line feed

   SP = %x20    ;; ASCII SPACE, space

   HTAB = %x09  ;; ASCII HTAB, horizontal tab

   WSP = SP / HTAB

   ESC = %x1B   ;; ASCII ESC, escape

   VCHAR = %x21-7E / ESC
	        ;; escape is included for ISO-2022-JP encoding [ISO-2022-JP]
   
   Mu_Line = Mu_prefix 1*WSP URL 1*WSP Mu_comment CRLF
   
   Mu_prefix = 1*VCHAR

   URL = "http://" 1*VCHAR / "ftp://" 1*VCHAR / "news:" 1*VCHAR

   Mu_comment = 1*VCHAR
